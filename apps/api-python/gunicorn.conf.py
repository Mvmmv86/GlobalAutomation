"""
Gunicorn configuration for FastAPI on Digital Ocean App Platform
Optimized for performance and concurrent request handling

CRITICAL FIX (2025-10-23):
- post_fork hook reconnects database after worker fork
- Fixes deadlock issue with preload_app=True + asyncpg
- Each worker gets independent database connection (fork-safe)
